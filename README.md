# Phone-and-Email-search
searches for valid Phone numbers and Emails

make sure You have _pyperclip_ installed on your machine. 
If not then install it before you run it.

However, I ran this code with python 3. If you run it with python 2.7 then no problem. Just make sure that pyperclip is installed in proper python version's _dist-packages_.


**Steps - **

1. copy the text you want to search within and run the program. That's it. :)

The emails have some weird rules. My code doesn't cover them all, but it covers the most typical ones.
